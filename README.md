BiteWise is a web-based project designed to make one of the most common student struggles—deciding what to eat—a little easier and a lot more thoughtful. Built around the idea that our emotions often influence our food choices, BiteWise helps students at Sunway University discover local food spots based on how they’re feeling. Whether it’s stress, boredom, happiness, sadness, or even frustration, the platform offers curated suggestions tailored to each mood.

This project was developed as part of the WEB1201 / WEB2014 Web Development coursework, and reflects both technical learning and real-life relevance. From mood-driven filtering to clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript integration, BiteWise brings together practical web development skills and a playful, student-centered concept.
